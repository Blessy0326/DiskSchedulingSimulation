## DiskSchedulingSimulation
A simple project that simulates different operating systems disk scheduling algorithms. This project uses the strategy pattern.

The following disk scheduling algorithms have been used:.
- FCFS (First come, first served).
- SSTF (Shortest seek time first).
- SCAN. 
- CSCAN (Circular SCAN).
- LOOK.
- CLOOK (Circular LOOK).
